<p>Well, it seems you want to know more about me</p>
<P>OK, let me introduce myself a little bit</P>
<p>I'm an ordinary owl living in this reign of owls</p>
<p>Day dreaming and night foraging</p>
<p>In many aspects I'm much like my kind</p>
<p>But I don't deliver letters and eat mice</p>
<p>Can you see the picture pinning above?</p>
<p>I'm something between these two creatures</p>
<p>Making war and peace</p>
<p>That's all</p>
<p>If you insist to get a little bit far</p>
<p>Here's a poem I recently enjoy:</p>
<p>-------------------------------</p>
<p>Funeral Blues</p>
<p>by W. H. Auden</p>
<p>
  Stop all the clocks, cut off the telephone,
  Prevent the dog from barking with a juicy bone,
  Silence the pianos and with muffled drum
  Bring out the coffin, let the mourners come.
  Let aeroplanes circle moaning overhead
  Scribbling on the sky the message ‘He is Dead’.
  Put crepe bows round the white necks of the public doves,
  Let the traffic policemen wear black cotton gloves.
  He was my North, my South, my East and West,
  My working week and my Sunday rest,
  My noon, my midnight, my talk, my song;
  I thought that love would last forever: I was wrong.
  The stars are not wanted now; put out every one,
  Pack up the moon and dismantle the sun,
  Pour away the ocean and sweep up the wood;
  For nothing now can ever come to any good.
