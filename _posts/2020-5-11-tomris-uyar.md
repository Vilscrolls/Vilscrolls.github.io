Today’s Doodle, illustrated by Istanbul-based guest artist Merve Atılgan, celebrates the prolific Turkish short story writer and translator Tomris Uyar. A leading figure in 1970s Turkish literature, Uyar was known for her realist style that often focused on the authentic depiction of female characters and family dynamics. On this day in 1980 and 1987, Uyar was honored with one of Turkish literature's most esteemed awards for short stories, the Sait Faik Story Award.

今天的Doodle，由驻伊斯坦布尔的客座艺术家Merve Atilgan绘制, 纪念土耳其多产的短篇小说作家兼翻译家Tomris Uyar。作为20世纪70年代土耳其文学的领军人物，Uyar以她侧重于真实地描写女性角色和家庭内部关系的的写实风格著称。在1980和1987年的今天，Uyar两次被授予Sait Faik故事奖 - 土耳其文学最受人尊敬的短篇小说奖之一。

Born in Istanbul on March 15, 1941, Uyar grew up attending American schools, and her access to English-language short fiction and Turkey’s contemporary literature served as a strong inspiration for the future writer.

出生于1941年3月15日，Uyar在美国的学校里长大，在此期间接触的英语短篇小说和土耳其当代文学对这位未来的作家产生了深远的影响。

Beginning her career as a translator, Uyar continued in the craft for the rest of her life, tackling avant-garde English fiction, and in the process developing a rare mastery of the intricacies of the Turkish language.

作为一名翻译开始她的职业生涯，Uyar一生都在从事对前卫英语小说的翻译工作，并在此过程中培养了对复杂的土耳其语的罕见掌握。

As a writer, she devoted herself to short fiction with a bit of support from her cats. Whenever one entered the room, she credited the felines for stimulating her writing process. These “inspiration cats,” referenced in the Doodle artwork, helped her to publish over 900 pages across 11 volumes of her stories throughout her career.

作为作家，她的猫为她专注短篇小说写作提供了很多的支持。在每一个客人来访时，她都会夸赞她的猫激励了她的写作过程。Doodle中提到的这些“灵感猫”，在她的整个职业生涯中帮助她出版了超过900页的11卷故事。

Amongst her greatest influences was Turkish writer Sait Faik, known for narrating evocative human stories unconstrained by form or plot. Drawing from influences like Faik, Uyar’s work pushed the boundaries of the form, employing postmodern techniques in the exploration of the lives of ordinary people, particularly from a female perspective. Over the years, her writing progressed to a caliber that positioned her to receive the aforementioned Sait Faik Story Award twice, a prize created in honor of the writer that had such a profound impact on Uyar and her narratives.

对她影响最大的是土耳其作家Sait Faik，他以写作不受形式和情节限制且令人回味的人类故事闻名。受到Faik等人的影响，Uyar的作品突破了形式的界限，她采用后现代的写作技巧探索普通百姓的生活，尤其是从女性的角度出发。随时间推移，写作能力的精进使她两次获得上述提到的Sait Faik故事奖 - 一个为纪念对Uyar和她的作品产生深远影响的作家Sait Faik而设立的奖项。

In current times, Uyar’s writing has been published in over 60 languages and is enjoyed by readers around the world to this day.

目前，Uyar的作品已以60多种语言出版，为世界各地的读者所喜爱。
